# One Max Problem
-
Use different algorithms to solve the one max problem and get the best score.<br>
The best score is mean that we get the most '1' in a binary array.

## Implement Algorithms

### Exhaustion Search
Give a number N, that will start from 0 to 2^N, then get the best score in each number.

### Hill Climbing
Random a number, search neighbor who has the best score than self for next iteration until to get the best score.

### Simulation Annealing
Like Hill Climbing Algorithm basically, the difference is the algorithm has some probability to choose worse neighbor until to get the best score.

### Genetic Algorithm
